<p>This semester I learned a little bit about Python. As a science person, it was cool to use Python to make DNA analysis a little easier. I wrote a small function to count k-mers that I’ve inserted below. It gives you back every possible k-mer, as well as the number of times it appears.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def count_kmers(sequence,k):
    counts = {}
    num_kmers = len(sequence) - k + 1
    for i in range(num_kmers):
        kmer = sequence[i:i+k]
        if kmer not in counts:
            counts[kmer] = 0
        counts[kmer] += 1
    return counts</code></pre>
<p>Now we can use this function on a sequence. I’ll create a sequence and find all the 3-mers for it.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>seq1 = &quot;AGGACTGACTTGACT&quot;
count_kmers(seq1,3)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## {&#39;CTT&#39;: 1, &#39;AGG&#39;: 1, &#39;TTG&#39;: 1, &#39;CTG&#39;: 1, &#39;GGA&#39;: 1, &#39;ACT&#39;: 3, &#39;GAC&#39;: 3, &#39;TGA&#39;: 2}</code></pre>
<p>That was much easier than maually finding all of the k-mers and counting them. Woohoo!</p>
