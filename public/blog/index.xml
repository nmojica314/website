      <description>This semester I learned a little bit about Python. As a science person, it was cool to use Python to make DNA analysis a little easier. I wrote a small function to count k-mers that I’ve inserted below. It gives you back every possible k-mer, as well as the number of times it appears.
def count_kmers(sequence,k): counts = {} num_kmers = len(sequence) - k + 1 for i in range(num_kmers): kmer = sequence[i:i+k] if kmer not in counts: counts[kmer] = 0 counts[kmer] += 1 return counts Now we can use this function on a sequence.</description>

      <description> Project 1 To conclude Unit I, I created an exploratory data analysis project. This project compared data about every country’s alcohol consumption and the percentage of their GDP spent on health care. Follow the link below to see what I found!

      <description> Project 2 After learning all about modeling in Unit 2, I created project 2. Project 2 expands on project 1, drawing together alcohol consumption and percentage of GDP spent on health care in every country. This project also looks at the population of each country. See below to learn about my findings.
