```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This semester I learned a little bit about Python. As a science person, it was cool to use Python to make DNA analysis a little easier. I wrote a small function to count k-mers that I've inserted below. It gives you back every possible k-mer, as well as the number of times it appears.

```{python}
def count_kmers(sequence,k):
    counts = {}
    num_kmers = len(sequence) - k + 1
    for i in range(num_kmers):
        kmer = sequence[i:i+k]
        if kmer not in counts:
            counts[kmer] = 0
        counts[kmer] += 1
    return counts
```

Now we can use this function on a sequence. I'll create a sequence and find all the 3-mers for it.

```{python}
seq1 = "AGGACTGACTTGACT"
count_kmers(seq1,3)
```

That was much easier than maually finding all of the k-mers and counting them. Woohoo!
